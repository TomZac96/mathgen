- Lots of overfull hboxes.

- Author names appear multiple times in a single reference.  Perhaps
  we should just embrace this as a feature of the program's
  context-free nature.

- Author names in citations don't match up with the author names in
  the text.  Likewise.

- The "blurb" product is highly repetitive and poorly formatted.  It
  needs to be massaged by hand to be amusing.  But I really only wrote
  it as a one-shot hack to have something to put on the back cover of
  the Lulu books.

- Citations should not appear in the abstract.  But this may be hard
  to fix without violating context-free-ness or excessive repetitition
  in the grammar.
